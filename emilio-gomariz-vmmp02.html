    <script>window.exhibition = {"title":"V.mmP.02","artist":"Emilio Gomariz","description":"Digital art can be seen as a recent occurred land on the map of the art world. Most of it is yet uncharted and only some artists have started exploring it . One of the artists, who is investigating this new field in a very playful approach is Emilio Gomariz. The Spanish artist has been trained as an industrial designer. Nowadays it seems like he spends a lot of time play around with his computer and keeps on discovering new ways to create digital art: He uses the Mac OSX interface, where he arranges files and windows into virtual performances. These are documented with a screen capturing software. The live performances are published as movies. Besides an interest in digital painting the artist's most popular works are Gifs. A seemingly endless stream of geometric patterns in the RGB colours create a mesmerizing visual effect resulting in a loop of time and space. For his exhibition 'V.mmP.02' Gomariz created a program that allows users to create their very own artworks. The user is able to fill the empty canvas with a waterfall of blue, green, red and white animated gradients that are exactly one pixel wide. The artist, who laments about the short attention span people have on the Internet, created a meditative experience.
