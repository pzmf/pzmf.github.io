    <script>window.exhibition = {"title":"Filter","artist":"Greg McCarron-Shipman","description":"The term \u2018converging cultures\u2019 describes the phenomena of cultures mixing together creating hybrid artworks including classic elements of different regions. With the on-going globalisation this term has become very popular, although the on-going emerge can be traced back to before the beginning of our time. What has changed in the contemporary culture is the pace cultures collide. Everything is mixing with everything much faster because we are much more aware of whats going on in different cultures. In an age of high definition imagery, we tend to apply degrading filter in order to create a sense of haptic to add the absent time. We make, create and generate with high velocity and most it is completely obsolete. We vibe. as we gaze through our windows we frame and filter as we gaze at our screens we frame and filter. infinity screens frames mundane snapchat drawings. Greg McCarron-Shipman is English born artist, whos work confronts the viewer in his work with the digitalisation of our culture and our lives. He illustrates the emerge of cultures in his work, where traditional sculptures like vases and taxidermied deer heads are opposed with contemporary objects like screens all brought together in a virtual image. The viewer experiences an arrangement of objects in an inconceivable form in the physical world, creating a moment of awe. The underlying examination of McCarron-Shipman digital arragement is the quality of digital objects in contrast to \u2018real\u2019 physical objects. What are the attributes of those objects and how are they translated into a two dimensonal space that gives the illusion to be 3 dimensonal. Greg McCarron lives and works in London.","url":"http:\/\/ns02.test\/greg-mccarron-shipman-filter","preview":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/exhibitions\/4\/image\/original\/filter-greg-preview.jpg","space":{"type":"default","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","birdseye":{"position":[0,1000,0],"rotation":[-20,0,0]}},"tags":[],"artworks":[{"id":0,"arrows":{"left":-1,"right":1},"name":"","type":"image","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/2\/image\/original\/1.gif","poster":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/2\/image\/thumb\/1.gif","size":[800,500],"position":[0,0,-1200],"rotation":[0,0,0],"instruction":null,"backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":1,"arrows":{"left":0,"right":2},"name":"","type":"scrub","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/scrubs\/5\/files\/1.jpg","totalFrames":121,"url":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/scrubs\/5\/files\/__frame__.jpg","size":[800,500],"loop":0,"position":[271,0,-2000],"rotation":[0,90,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":2,"arrows":{"left":1,"right":3},"name":"","type":"video","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/videos\/33\/poster\/original\/3-thumb.jpg","videos":[{"url":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/videos\/artworks\/hd\/127347452.mp4","type":"video\/mp4"}],"size":["320","568"],"loop":1,"autoplay":1,"controls":0,"position":[3900,0,-2800],"rotation":[0,0,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":3,"arrows":{"left":2,"right":4},"name":"","type":"scrub","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/scrubs\/6\/files\/1.jpg","totalFrames":19,"url":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/scrubs\/6\/files\/__frame__.jpg","size":[800,500],"loop":0,"position":[-300,0,-2400],"rotation":[0,0,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":4,"arrows":{"left":3,"right":5},"name":"","type":"image","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/78\/image\/original\/5.gif","poster":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/78\/image\/thumb\/5.gif","size":[800,500],"position":[-300,0,-3000],"rotation":[0,-90,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":5,"arrows":{"left":4,"right":6},"name":"","type":"scrub","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/scrubs\/7\/files\/1.jpg","totalFrames":41,"url":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/scrubs\/7\/files\/__frame__.jpg","size":[800,500],"loop":0,"position":[0,0,-3700],"rotation":[0,-180,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":6,"arrows":{"left":5,"right":7},"name":"","type":"video","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/videos\/34\/poster\/original\/7.jpg","videos":[{"url":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/videos\/artworks\/hd\/127347502.mp4","type":"video\/mp4"}],"size":["320","568"],"loop":1,"autoplay":1,"controls":0,"position":[900,0,-4200],"rotation":[0,0,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":1},{"id":7,"arrows":{"left":6,"right":8},"name":"","type":"scrub","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/scrubs\/8\/files\/1.jpg","totalFrames":61,"url":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/scrubs\/8\/files\/__frame__.jpg","size":[800,500],"loop":0,"position":[-1800,0,-4200],"rotation":[60,0,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":8,"arrows":{"left":7,"right":9},"name":"","type":"scrub","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/scrubs\/9\/files\/1.jpg","totalFrames":41,"url":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/scrubs\/9\/files\/__frame__.jpg","size":[800,500],"loop":0,"position":[-2200,0,-4900],"rotation":[0,0,60],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":9,"arrows":{"left":8,"right":10},"name":"","type":"image","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/3\/image\/original\/12.gif","poster":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/3\/image\/thumb\/12.gif","size":[800,500],"position":[0,0,-8000],"rotation":[255,0,0],"instruction":null,"backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":10,"arrows":{"left":9,"right":11},"name":"","type":"image","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/4\/image\/original\/12.gif","poster":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io
