Video footage has been manipulated and merged together into an animated story. Their main focus rests on western folklore. Exposed to these transmitted tales from a very young age, they deeply shape our system of belief, for example, the princess who gets rescued by the prince. \u2018Through this project we wanted to focus on our experiences with folklore, and re-invent these stories in a new way.\" say the two artists. \"It was important to us to re-tell old stories, while using an empowered female character who was in control of her surroundings. Upon creating all of the scenes, we wanted a consistent theme through this piece to be the idea of growing up and being shown things like sex, gender, and love. We feel many modern stories soften the blow of the real world, so we wanted the film to offer a different perspective on growing up.\"","url":"http:\/\/pzmf.github.io\/mike-claire-ghost-hole","preview":"https:\/\/pzmf.github.io\/media\/exhibitions\/7\/image\/original\/mikeandclaire-preview.jpg","space":{"type":"default","backgroundColor":"#000000","foregroundColor":"#ffffff","birdseye":{"position":[0,0,0],"rotation":[0,0,0]}},"tags":[],"artworks":[{"id":0,"arrows":{"left":-1,"right":1},"name":"","type":"video","image":"https:\/\/pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/videos\/32\/poster\/original\/ghost-hole-with-credits.jpg","videos":[{"url":"https:\/\/pzmf.github.io\/media\/videos\/artworks\/hd\/127346933.mp4","type":"video\/mp4"}],"size":["1280","720"],"loop":1,"autoplay":1,"controls":1,"position":[0,0,-1000],"rotation":[0,0,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#000000","foregroundColor":"#ffffff","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0}],"endslide_arrow":0};window.suggestions = [{"url":"http:\/\/pzmf.github.io\/mike-claire-ghost-hole","image":"https:\/\/pzmf.github.io\/media\/exhibitions\/7\/image\/original\/mikeandclaire-preview.jpg","title":"Ghost Hole","artist":"Mike & Claire"},{"url":"http:\/\/pzmf.github.io\/vince-mckelvie-la-turbo-avedon-the-club-rothko-selection-part-1","image":"https:\/\/pzmf.github.io\/media\/exhibitions\/11\/image\/original\/club-rothko-1-preview.jpg","title":"The Club Rothko Selection Part 1","artist":"Vince Mckelvie & La Turbo Avedon "},{"url":"http:\/\/pzmf.github.io\/ofluxo-datamine-conflux","image":"https:\/\/pzmf.github.io\/media\/exhibitions\/13\/image\/original\/datamine-conflux-preview.jpg","title":"Datamine Conflux","artist":"Ofluxo"}];</script>
