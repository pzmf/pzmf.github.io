    <script>window.exhibition = {"title":"Walking a Line in Minecraft","artist":"Jan Robert Leegte","description":"Jan Robert Leegte\u2019s exhibition titled 'Walking a Line in Minecraft (After Richard Long\u2019s Walking a Line in Peru, 1972)' needs little explanation: The Dutch artist reinterpreted the well-known artwork 'Walking a Line' by Richard Long and thereby transfers land art in a digital environment. By reinacting this performance in a virtual landscape his work suggests that an interaction within any environment can be an artistic gesture and is not only limited to the physical world. Whereas Long has been walking a straight line in Peru, Leegte injected his spin of the land art piece into the non-site of Minecraft. 'Walking a Line\u2019 is the second land art adaptation by Jan Robert Leegte. He already recreated the Spiral Jetty by Robert Smithson on a pixelated beach somewhere in the adventurous world of Minecraft. The game encourages users to \u201cbuild anything they can imagine\u201d\u2014and provides an ideal support for Leegte\u2019s Line. The Dutch artist has documented the seemingly pain-staking building process in 16 images. The two videos, placed in the end of the exhibition, let the viewer see the result of the performance from sunrise to sunset in a time-lapse.","url":"http:\/\/ns02.test\/ja-robert-leegte-walking-a-line-in-minecraft","preview":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/exhibitions\/8\/image\/original\/walking-minecraft-preview.jpg","space":{"type":"default","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","birdseye":{"position":[-800,1500,0],"rotation":[-30,0,0]}},"tags":[],"artworks":[{"id":0,"arrows":{"left":-1,"right":1},"name":"","type":"image","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/63\/image\/original\/5.jpg","poster":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/63\/image\/thumb\/5.jpg","size":[1000,625],"position":[0,0,-2000],"rotation":[0,0,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":1,"arrows":{"left":0,"right":2},"name":"","type":"image","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/64\/image\/original\/20.jpg","poster":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/64\/image\/thumb\/20.jpg","size":[1000,625],"position":[-1500,0,-2000],"rotation":[0,0,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":2,"arrows":{"left":1,"right":3},"name":"","type":"image","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/65\/image\/original\/25.jpg","poster":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/65\/image\/thumb\/25.jpg","size":[1000,625],"position":[-3000,0,-2000],"rotation":[0,0,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":3,"arrows":{"left":2,"right":4},"name":"","type":"image","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/66\/image\/original\/30.jpg","poster":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/66\/image\/thumb\/30.jpg","size":[1000,625],"position":[-3500,0,-2500],"rotation":[0,-90,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":4,"arrows":{"left":3,"right":5},"name":"","type":"image","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/67\/image\/original\/35.jpg","poster":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/67\/image\/thumb\/35.jpg","size":[1000,625],"position":[-3500,0,-4000],"rotation":[0,-90,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":5,"arrows":{"left":4,"right":6},"name":"","type":"image","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/68\/image\/original\/45.jpg","poster":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/68\/image\/thumb\/45.jpg","size":[1000,625],"position":[-3500,0,-5500],"rotation":[0,-90,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":6,"arrows":{"left":5,"right":7},"name":"","type":"image","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/69\/image\/original\/60.jpg","poster":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/69\/image\/thumb\/60.jpg","size":[1000,625],"position":[-3000,0,-6000],"rotation":[0,-180,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":7,"arrows":{"left":6,"right":8},"name":"","type":"image","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/70\/image\/original\/65.jpg","poster":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/70\/image\/thumb\/65.jpg","size":[1000,625],"position":[-1500,0,-6000],"rotation":[0,-180,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":8,"arrows":{"left":7,"right":9},"name":"","type":"image","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/71\/image\/original\/70.jpg","poster":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/71\/image\/thumb\/70.jpg","size":[1000,625],"position":[0,0,-6000],"rotation":[0,-180,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":9,"arrows":{"left":8,"right":10},"name":"","type":"image","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/72\/image\/original\/75.jpg","poster":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/72\/image\/thumb\/75.jpg","size":[1000,625],"position":[1500,0,-6000],"rotation":[0,-180,0],"instruction":"","backgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","foregroundColor":"#000000","viewport":"contain","fittoscreen":0},{"id":10,"arrows":{"left":9,"right":11},"name":"","type":"image","image":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/73\/image\/original\/105.jpg","poster":"https:\/\/https://pzmf.github.io\/media\/artworks\/images\/73\/image\/thumb\/105.jpg","size":[1000,625],"position":[2000,0,-5500],"rotation":[0,-270,0],
